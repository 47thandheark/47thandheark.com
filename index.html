  <h1>Meet 47th& Heark.</h1>
<p>
 The intersection of harmonic brilliance and rebellious decibel levels. On any standard weekend evening, the band can be found at neighboring establishments providing local nocturnal marauders with their daily dose of heart pumping sound waves. There’s a song on their set list for every musical enthusiast out there. They cover everything from timeless classics of the 70s, like Jackson Browne’s Running on Empty, to that Bruno Mars song you just heard on the radio. You would be hard pressed to find a recurring Heark Street aficionado who couldn’t recite the lyrics to “Twist and Shout” the morning following one of the band’s blowout. In fact, to show fan appreciation, it’s band policy to welcome all supporters to enjoy and unwind with an earlymorning breakfast at a local late night Diner after each adrenaline-fueled show. Comprised of four clowns, countess instruments, and an abundance of overconfidence in fantasy football knowledge; it is clearly evident this band has the wherewithal to turn a great night, into an unprecedented circus.
